# First-SDL-Game 2.0 (BRICK BREAKER)
First attemp to create a game using SDL 2.0 for my programming course.

  # BrickBreaker
  Brick Breaker is a Breakout clone which the player must smash a wall of bricks by deflecting a bouncing ball with a paddle. The paddle may move horizontally and is controlled with the computer's mouse.
  # How to play
  To start the game, simply click left button once. Then, you control the paddle to reflect the ball and let it hit as many bricks as you can. When there is no brick left, the game will reset.
  # Control 
  Movements of the paddle use only the computer's mouse.
  # Preview
